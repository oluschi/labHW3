 	<h1> Genovia's Pear Sorbet</h1>
	<blockquote>
        <p>Sorbet is a delectable frozen dessert, made with sweetened water and fruit juice, fruit puree or wine flavouring. This tradtional Genovian treat is made from the countries signature fruit, Pear! It is served as a low fat alternative to ice cream and has a crunchy texture. As the Prime Minister said, it is often used as a palate cleanser between meals as well as for dessert. <br><mark> WARNING:</mark> </br> Do not digest too much at once, it may lead to harmful results.</p>
